Description: Creates simulated clinical trial data with realistic correlation structures and assumed efficacy levels by using a tilted bootstrap resampling approach. Samples are drawn from observed data with some samples appearing more frequently than others. May also be used for simulating from a joint Bayesian distribution along with clinical trials based on the Bayesian distribution.
